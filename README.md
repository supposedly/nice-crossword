# Nice crossword

## Mission statement
I want to make a crossword puzzle (singular). There are no good crossword puzzle editors out there right now\*. In order to make my crossword puzzle (singular), I'm going to do the bare minimum\*\* to make an editor that's (1) usable, (2) usable on mobile, (3) free, and (4) still hosted after I've stopped developing it. There's no way this can be that hard\*\*\*.
